This repository contains the challenges for CoderCo Community

Challenge 1
You're the new DevOps hire at a startup. 
They've given you a fresh Linux VM and asked you to build a 
production-ready Linux service setup for their Python app. But 
there's no infra — you have to do it all.

Upcoming challenges in the next few weeks. Stay tuned!
