<h1 align="center" id="title">⚙️ My CoderCo Hub</h1>

<p align="center" id="description">
🛠️ A curated collection of hands-on DevOps projects designed to deepen my expertise and simulate real-world engineering workflows.
<br>
Each project explores a key aspect of the DevOps lifecycle — from CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code to observability, containerization, and secure cloud deployment.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

This hub includes projects built using:

- **Linux** — foundational systems fluency
- **Bash** — scripting for automation and control
- **AWS** — infrastructure deployment and scaling
- **Docker / Kubernetes** — container orchestration and management
- **Terraform** — infrastructure as code
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD pipelines
- **Prometheus & Grafana** — observability and monitoring
- **Ansible** — configuration management

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is more than a portfolio — it’s a journal of intentional practice and applied problem-solving.  
My focus is to:

- Build systems thinking through repeatable, versioned DevOps workflows
- Practice reliability engineering under realistic conditions
- Understand the “why” behind tools, not just the “how”
- Document learnings, pivots, and lessons with transparency

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Each project lives in its own folder with:
- `README.md`: problem statement, architecture, decisions, and learnings
- Source code, infra configs, scripts
- Reflections or retrospectives if applicable

## 📝 Reflections

> _"Documentation isn’t an afterthought. It’s a window into decision-making."_  
This repo reflects not just outputs, but mindset shifts — especially when things break, pivot, or evolve.
