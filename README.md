<h1 align="center" id="title">⚙️ My CoderCo DevOps Hub</h1>

<p align="center" id="description">
A growing collection of hands-on DevOps projects — built to level up my real-world engineering skills, one module at a time.
<br>
Each project dives into a key area of the DevOps lifecycle — from scripting and automation to cloud deployment, observability, and infrastructure-as-code.

## 🧰 Tools I’m Using

This hub brings together a wide stack of technologies, including:

- **Linux** — getting comfortable with the terminal and system fundamentals
- **Bash** — automating everyday tasks and building muscle memory
- **Git & GitHub** — tracking progress, documenting growth, and working the DevOps way
- **Networking** — learning how the internet actually works
- **Docker** — packaging and shipping apps in containers
- **AWS** — exploring cloud services and infrastructure
- **Terraform** — managing infrastructure like code
- **CI/CD** — setting up repeatable, automated pipelines
- **Kubernetes** — learning to orchestrate and scale containerized apps
- **Azure** — experimenting with Microsoft's cloud ecosystem

## 🎯 Why This Exists

This isn’t just a portfolio. It’s a learning lab.  
It’s where I:

- Practice building and breaking systems
- Learn through doing (and debugging)
- Document not just *what* I did, but *why*
- Reflect on wins, roadblocks, and mindset shifts
- Treat my growth like real engineering work: iterative, intentional, and visible

## 🗂️ How It's Organized

Each module or project has its own folder with:

- A `README.md`: includes the brief, architecture, decisions, and reflections
- Code/scripts/configs related to the project
- Notes or retrospectives if something interesting happened (and something usually does)

## 📝 Reflections

> _"Documentation isn’t an afterthought. It’s a window into decision-making."_  
This repo reflects not just outputs, but mindset shifts — especially when things break, pivot, or evolve.
